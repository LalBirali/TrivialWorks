Memorandum to Management: Milestone 4

AUTHORS: Lal Birali and Kevin Enright

INTRODUCTION
The project that our group has been working on for the past several weeks is the design of a distributed K-V system to store mountains of data, that are distributed over several "nodes". This undertaking starts in Milestone One, where the goal is to read in data from an .SOR file, where data comes in from a specific source format, parsed and then stored into a data frame. We also allow for simple command line arguments for basic querying. We have a Makefile, that will can build, run tests, and run valgrind on our project via the make build , make tests , and make val commands. In Milestone Two, we were able to split our DataFrame into n number of nodes that was specified by input into the command line. For Milestone Four we added code that will eventually support client/server architecture and were able to serialize our objects using the boost library.

ARCHITECTURE/IMPLEMENTATION
As of now, what has been implemented, as shown in the src/ folder is a SorParser.h file that reads in a file, and returns a Data Frame. This Data Frame is then passed into our Test class that also resides in a main.cpp file. Basic tests are run to ensure data integrity and quality. After this, the Data Frame currently supports this functionality, as provided by a previous assignment:

Adding rows
Adding columns
Setting values
Getting values
Getting number of rows and columns
Setting column names and rows
Setting an index row
Map operations that perform aggregations
Filter operations that includes data based on some provided test
Our Data Frame is also now split into n number of nodes specified by command line argument and these new DataFrames are stored in our KV Store.

We added in code to support messaging between clients that allows our server to send serialized dataframes to nodes. (We will eventually set up the nodes to be the only things to contain those sections of the dataframe and delete all other instances but did not have time to do so.

USE CASES
Work in progress:

If make val or make test is run from the command line, then should see all tests pass along with prompts for user input.

Assuming basic querying from the command line are working â€“ the following command line arguments should be available to user:

--getRow rowNum (0-indexed) e.g. getRow 2
--getColumn colNum (0-indexed) e.g.getColumn 3
--get row col e.g. get 0 0
--getType colNum e.g. getType 2
Error messages

OPEN QUESTIONS
--Switching the KV Store to store serialized dataframes instead of actual dataframes
--Refactor our code to allow for easier testing
--Switch our command line querying to use the nodes to get information instead of the original dataframe.
--Deserialize dataframes on the client side and allow for querying of the nodes.
STATUS
The current status of the project is that querying via the command line appears to have some bugs, but all data integrity appears to be maintained. The parsing of the file and storage of current data is occurring accurately. Our next phase to kill bugs and fix the server/client logic to support querying over that and then switch our KV store to store serialized dataframes instead of actual dataframes.

(Apologies for the incompleteness of this assignment, one of us had a death in the family and we have been trying to get as much done as possible given the horrible circumstances)
